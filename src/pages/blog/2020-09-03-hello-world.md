There are a number of people I know who regret not penning down their experiences in a blog when they were younger. Hence, I am starting a new tech blog so I will not have the same regrets when I am older. 

One thing I noticed about most blogs is that there'll be a number of blog posts in the first few months, a really long break (i.e. a few years) before the next post, and the blog dies after that. I imagine that it goes something like this:

![Blog posts over time](/img/blog-posts-over-time.png "Blog posts over time")

There's a good chance that this blog will follow the trend, but I guess only time will tell.

It takes real dedication to maintain a blog, which is why I have never written one. Besides, who reads them anyway? However, I've spent quite a while developing this website (which I will cover in a separate post), so hopefully the sunk costs will motivate me to write more consistently.

Here's to many more blog posts and less regrets. That's all folks!
